/**
 * Model - View - Presenter
 *
 * The MVP pattern allows separating the presentation layer from the logic so that
 * everything about how the UI works is agnostic from how we represent it on screen.
 *
 * The first thing to clarify is that MVP is not an architecture by itself, itâ€™s only responsible for the presentation layer.
 *
 *
 * Why Use MVP?
 *
 * In Android, we have a problem arising from the fact that Android activities are closely coupled to both UI and data access mechanisms.
 *
 * For an application to be easily extensible and maintainable, we need to define well-separated layers.
 *
 * We divide the application into at least three different layers, which lets us test them independently.
 * With MVP we take most of the logic out from the activities so that we can test it without using instrumentation tests.
 *
 *
 *
 * MVP has some risks, and the most important one is that the presenter is attached to the view forever.
 * And the view is an activity, which means that:
 *
 * We can leak the activity with long-running tasks
 * We can try to update activities that have already died
 *
